Abgabe 1:
    4. benchmark (runtime and memory) your solutions for 1’000, 10’000, 100’000 1’000’000
    queries of length 100. 
    We chose length 40 instead, because our naive algorihm gets no results with the other lengths.

    5. Benchmark (runtime) queries of the length 40, 60, 80, and 100 with a suitable number
    of queries. Number of queries chosen: 1000

    for naive search runtime is not meaningful because the algorithm doesnt find occurences with a text length larger than 40
